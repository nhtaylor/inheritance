# inheritance

This repository stores the code for my thesis, where I examined the impact that inheritances have on wealth accumulation and how intergeneration wealth transfers contribute to the racial wealth gap.

For some reason, I decided to label my data extracts from the National Longitudinal Survey based on the NATO phonetic alpha. By the time I had the exact extract I needed, I ended at "golf."

There are three folders in this repository: one for the data extract itself, another for the code scripts, and a final one including regression results in HTML format. The coding scripts, found in the "script" folder, break down into four separate documents.

1. The National Longitudinal Survey's script for their raw data. I have edited their code down to include only the variables that I want to turn into factors.

2. My own cleaning script for my variables of interest. My work involved creating meaningful variable names, resolve NA's, recode necessary variables, and organize the data in a format ready for analysis. I realized, by the end of my work, that I could have decreased my time on certain tasks had I created my own functions. A good lesson to learn.

3. Code for descriptive statistics related to the NLSY79 data. Some of the code here was actually used to create the tables for my thesis, while other statistics found here (likelihood of someone receiving their first inheritance vs their second throughout the NLSY79 dataset).

4. My time series analysis (pooled regression, first difference estimation, and fixed effects).
